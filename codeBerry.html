    <h1>True facts about the mantis shrimp</h1>

        and are highly colored.</p>

    <h2>Attack</h2>
    <p>Mantis shrimps have two methods of attack; they can be <strong> spearers </strong> or <strong> smashers
        </strong>.
        <br>They strike by rapidly unfolding and swinging their claws at the prey and can cause serious damage to
        victims larger than themselves. </p>
    <h2>Eyesight</h2>
    <p>Their eyes are mounted on mobile stalks and constantly move about independently of each other. They are
        considered to be the most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.
        <br>The mantis shrimp has such good eyes that it can perceive both polarized light and color vision outside
        the normal visual spectrum. </p>
